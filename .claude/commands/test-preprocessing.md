Run comprehensive preprocessing tests on sample images:

1. Load test images from /data/raw/samples/
2. Apply LASSR super-resolution and measure improvement
3. Test segmentation accuracy
4. Validate illumination normalization
5. Compare against research benchmarks:
   - LASSR: 21% improvement expected
   - Overall: 25-35% accuracy gain
