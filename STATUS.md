# FarmFlow Development Status

## Current Phase: Phase 1 - Preprocessing Pipeline
**Timeline**: Weeks 1-2

### Completed
- [x] Research documentation
- [x] Repository structure
- [x] Claude.md configuration

### In Progress
- [ ] LASSR implementation (21% accuracy gain)
- [ ] U-Net segmentation (98.66% accuracy)
- [ ] Retinex illumination normalization
- [ ] Multi-color space fusion

### Upcoming
- [ ] CycleGAN training setup
- [ ] Model architecture implementation
- [ ] iOS conversion pipeline

## Blockers
- None currently

## Next Steps
1. Implement LASSR super-resolution in `/preprocessing/lassr.py`
2. Validate 21% accuracy improvement
3. Implement U-Net segmentation
4. Test on iPhone HEIC images

## Notes
- Remember: We have 1-2 seconds inference budget - use it!
- Field performance is key metric, not lab accuracy
- CycleGAN is critical - prevents 45-68% accuracy drop

## Important Notes
- Unknown is detected via uncertainty, not trained as a class
- Models output 7 classes only
- Need 2000 OOD samples for threshold calibration (not training)
