# FarmFlow Production Training Status

## Overview
Transitioning from prototype (ImageNet-based) to production-ready trained system using 188,579 real plant disease images across 6 datasets.

## Target Performance
- **Laboratory Accuracy**: 99.2%
- **Field Accuracy**: 82-87%
- **Unknown Detection**: 94% precision, 91% recall
- **Inference Time**: <1.5s on iPhone
- **Model Size**: <100MB compressed

## Training Progress

### ✅ Day 1: Data Organization (COMPLETE)
**Status**: Successfully analyzed and organized 188,579 images

**Dataset Distribution**:
- PlantVillage: 41,272 images (lab conditions)
- New Plant Disease: 140,590 images (semi-field/augmented)
- Plant Pathology 2020: 3,642 images (field)
- Rice Leaf Disease: 240 images (field bacterial blight)
- Potato Viral: 2,826 images (field mosaic virus)

**Class Distribution**:
- Healthy: 48,916 images
- Blight: 31,343 images (includes 80 field images from rice)
- Leaf Spot: 51,798 images
- Powdery Mildew: 6,838 images
- Mosaic Virus: 10,058 images (includes 2,556 field images from potato)
- Unknown: 39,626 images

**Key Achievement**: Rice dataset solves blight field imbalance, Potato dataset solves mosaic virus field imbalance.

### ✅ Day 2: Balanced Splits Creation (COMPLETE)
**Status**: Created train/val/test splits with field-only validation

**Split Statistics**:
- Training: 108,552 images (90.2%)
- Validation: 11,305 images (9.4%)
- Test: 461 images (0.4%)

**Three-Tier Strategy**:
1. **Lab Tier**: All PlantVillage → training only
2. **Semi-Field Tier**: 90% training, 10% validation
3. **Field Tier**: 70/15/15 split for honest metrics

**Critical Issue**: Validation set only has 4.1% field data (needs improvement)

**Mixed Batch Training Strategy**:
- 40% lab + 40% semi-field + 20% field per batch
- Prevents domain overfitting
- Essential for 82-87% field accuracy

---

### ⏳ Day 3: Tier 1 Model Training (IN PROGRESS)
**Status**: Script created, ready to train

**Model**: EfficientFormer-L7
- Target: 95%+ lab accuracy, <20ms inference
- Fast screening for cascade system
- 30 epochs with cosine annealing
- Focal loss for class imbalance
- Mixed batch training implemented

**Next Steps**:
1. Run training script (requires GPU)
2. Monitor for overfitting
3. Track field-specific accuracy

---

### 🔜 Day 4: Tier 2 Model Training (PENDING)
**Model**: EfficientNet-B4
- Target: 99%+ accuracy
- 600-800ms inference
- Detailed analysis tier

---

### 🔜 Day 5: Field Fine-Tuning (PENDING)
**Strategy**: Fine-tune on field data
- CycleGAN domain adaptation
- Test-time augmentation
- Critical for 82-87% field accuracy

---

### 🔜 Day 6: Ensemble Strategy (PENDING)
**Components**:
- Weighted voting
- Confidence calibration
- Cascade routing logic

---

### 🔜 Day 7: Unknown Detection Calibration (PENDING)
**Methods**:
- Temperature scaling
- One-class SVM
- Threshold optimization

## Current Bottlenecks

1. **Field Data Scarcity**: Only 4.1% of validation is field data
   - Solution: Need to reorganize splits to prioritize field validation

2. **GPU Requirements**: Training requires CUDA-capable GPU
   - Solution: Can use Google Colab or cloud GPU

3. **Class Imbalance**: Powdery mildew has fewest samples (6,838)
   - Solution: Focal loss + oversampling implemented

## Commands to Run

```bash
# Day 1: Organize data (COMPLETE)
python training/data_organization.py

# Day 2: Create splits (COMPLETE)
python training/create_splits.py

# Day 3: Train Tier 1 (READY TO RUN)
python training/train_tier1.py

# Day 4: Train Tier 2 (PENDING)
python training/train_tier2.py

# Day 5: Field fine-tuning (PENDING)
python training/finetune_field.py
```

## Key Insights

1. **Data Quality**: We have sufficient data (188K images) but field data is limited
2. **Domain Gap**: Lab-to-field transfer is the biggest challenge
3. **Unknown Detection**: Critical for safety - better to flag unknown than misdiagnose
4. **Mixed Training**: Essential to mix lab/semi-field/field in each batch

## Expected Timeline

With GPU access:
- Day 3-5: 2-3 days of training
- Day 6-7: 1 day for ensemble and calibration
- Total: 3-4 days to production model

Without GPU:
- Consider using pretrained weights
- Focus on fine-tuning only
- Use smaller batch sizes

## Success Metrics

✅ Achieved:
- Data organization complete
- Balanced splits created
- Training pipeline ready

⏳ In Progress:
- Model training
- Field validation

🔜 Pending:
- Domain adaptation
- Ensemble creation
- Unknown calibration
